      "Hi! I’m Rayzell, a second-year Computer Science and Master of Management student at UBC with a deep interest in healthcare and the human impact of technology. Whether it's simplifying health data for researchers or brightening a child’s day in the ER, I’ve learned that the most meaningful solutions begin with empathy.",
      "While I enjoy coding and creating, I care just as much about why I build — to make systems more supportive, more accessible, and more human.",
      "Outside of school, I play guitar in a rock band, volunteer in pediatric care, and am on an endless quest to master latte art (still very much a work-in-progress).",
      "I’m currently looking for co-op opportunities where I can merge my technical skills with my passion for people and real-world impact."
